            Patience Hostel, with its unique sense of history and place, is devoted to creating enduring relationships with our guests and members by providing highly personalized service and gracious hospitality in an informally elegant atmosphere. Our greatest
            asset, and the key to our success, is our people. We believe that true world-class status is only achieved when a resort combines the traditions of its local community with exceptional personal service. We believe each of us need a sense of
            dignity, pride and satisfaction in what we do. Because satisfying our guests depends on the united efforts of many, we are most effective when we work together cooperatively, respecting each otherâ€™s contributions and importance. We also ensure
            the safety and security of our guests and have access to the Ghana police and Fire Service in case of any emergencies.
